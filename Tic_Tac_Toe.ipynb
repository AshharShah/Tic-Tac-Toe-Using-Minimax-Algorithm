    "7. Create a Minimax algorithm function: This function will use the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best move for the computer player.

In each iteration of the loop, the player makes a move, the game board is updated, and the winner is checked. If there is a winner, the game loop ends, and the winner is announced. If there is no winner, the computer player calculates its move using the Minimax algorithm, makes the move, and the game loop continues.\n",
